## Description
This application was created as a little javascript quiz, it features a timer that decrements when a wrong answer is logged, and a score that increments when a correct answer is logged. After the quiz is complete, it will prompt a user for their initials if the user's current score is the user's high score. The user's initials, score and time remaining are then logged in the high score section.
